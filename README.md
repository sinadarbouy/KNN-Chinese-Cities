# KNN-Chinese-Cities
This project works with different aspects of AI tools by implementing a small machine learning system.
* The file Cities.zip contains a database of weather, climate, and pollution measurements from five Chinese cities.
  * The target variable is called "PM_HIGH" and represents the event that the pollution level, measured as a concentration of particles called PM2.5, is higher than 100 ug/m^3.
 
* This project implements a class in Python, a k-nearest-neighbor (KNN) classifier using the fit, predict, and score pattern.
* The classifier is then applied to the Chinese city pollution dataset, by predicting the binary target variable PM_HIGH from the remaining variables.
* The system is trained and validated based on the cities of Beijing and Shenyang.
* Finally, the classifier separately is evaluated based on the cities of Guangzhou and Shanghai.
